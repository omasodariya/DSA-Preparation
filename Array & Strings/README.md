# Arrays and Strings - DSA

## Overview

Arrays and Strings are some of the most fundamental data structures in programming and form the basis of many algorithmic problems. Understanding how to manipulate arrays and strings efficiently is crucial for technical interviews and real-world problem solving.

- **Array:** A collection of elements identified by index or key, stored contiguously in memory.
- **String:** A sequence of characters, often treated like an array of characters with additional operations.

Arrays allow quick access to elements by index (O(1) time), but inserting or deleting elements in the middle can be costly (O(n) time). Strings require handling character sequences and problems often involve pattern searching, substring manipulation, or palindrome checks.

## Key Patterns to Know

- **Two Pointers:** Use two indices moving in the array/string to solve problems like reversing, partitioning, or searching pairs.
- **Sliding Window:** For problems involving substrings or subarrays, where you look for a contiguous sequence satisfying some condition.
- **Hashing:** Use hash maps or sets to track occurrences, counts, or to quickly check for duplicates.
- **Sorting & Searching:** Basic sorting helps with arranging elements; binary search and its variants speed up search queries on sorted arrays.
